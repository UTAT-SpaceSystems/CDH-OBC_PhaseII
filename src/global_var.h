	*	FILE NAME:		global_var.h
	*
	*	PURPOSE:		This file contains global variable definitions to be used across all files.
	*	
	*
	*	FILE REFERENCES:		stdio.h
	*
	*	EXTERNAL VARIABLES:		None
	*
	*	EXTERNAL REFERENCES:	Same a File References.
	*
	*	ABORNOMAL TERMINATION CONDITIONS, ERROR AND WARNING MESSAGES: None yet.
	*
	*	ASSUMPTIONS, CONSTRAINTS, CONDITIONS:	None
	*
	*	NOTES:					All future additions to this list of global variables should have
	*							'glob' somewhere in their name so that it is obvious that they are
	*							global.
	*
	*							The need for arrays that store can message information because tasks
	*							may require the data contained in a can mailbox outside of the interrupt
	*							handler. It doesn't make sense to reacquire the information from the 
	*							CAN controller every time it is required because we're adding much more
	*							code and complexity. 
	*
	*							There shouldn't be any concurrency issues, although just to be safe:
	*							ALL TASKS MUST ACQUIRE THE CAN MUTEX LOCK BEFORE READING CAN GLOBAL REGS.
	*
	*							Not all global variables are contained within this file.
