	*	FILE NAME:		command_test.c
	*
	*	PURPOSE:		
	*	This file will be used to test commands with our CAN API.
	*
	*	FILE REFERENCES:	stdio.h, FreeRTOS.h, task.h, partest.h, asf.h, can_func.h
	*
	*	EXTERNAL VARIABLES:
	*
	*	EXTERNAL REFERENCES:	Same a File References.
	*
	*	ABORNOMAL TERMINATION CONDITIONS, ERROR AND WARNING MESSAGES: None yet.
	*
	*	ASSUMPTIONS, CONSTRAINTS, CONDITIONS:	None
	*
	*	NOTES:	 
	*	Remember that configTICK_RATE_HZ in FreeRTOSConfig.h is currently set to 10 Hz and
	*	so when that is set to a new value, the amount of ticks in between housekeeping will
	*	have to be adjusted.
	*	
	*	REQUIREMENTS/ FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATION REFERENCES:			
	*	New tasks should be written to use as much of CMSIS as possible. The ASF and 
	*	FreeRTOS API libraries should also be used whenever possible to make the program
	*	more portable.

	*	DEVELOPMENT HISTORY:		
	*	02/01/2015		Created
	*
	*	02/06/2015		I managed to get the CAN API function send_command working.
	*
	*	02/17/2015		I made some changes to send_command() in can_func.c with regards to
	*					how the ID of the mailboxes is being set.
	*
	*	08/02/2015		Added the high_comman_generator in accordance with the new CAN communication structure.
	*
	*	DESCRIPTION:	
	*
	*	This file is being used to test our CAN commands API. This file is used to encapsulate a 
	*	test function called command_test(), which will create a task that will send out a can message
	*	from CAN0 MB7 to CAN1 MB0 with the use of a CAN API function I have written send_can_command().
	*
	*	It will then delay 15 clock cycles and send the message again.
